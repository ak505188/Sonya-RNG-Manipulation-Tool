## Sonya RNG Manipulation Helper
This is a quick and dirty tool to help with a RNG manipulation in the PS1 game Suikoden.
You can use the Hero unit's position to figure out what seed your on.

#### Usage
This comes with my images and positions for the 108\* Glitchless route.
To replace with your own, you can swap out the images in the `images` folder
and modify the position data in `data.js`.

To run this, just download this repo and open `index.html`.
